# codewars_solutions
A collection of Python solutions to Codewars challenges, demonstrating my problem‑solving approach, clean coding practices, and continuous learning.

# Codewars Solutions – Python

This repository contains my Python solutions to various **Codewars** challenges.  
All tasks are grouped inside a single file and documented with their respective *kyu* level.  
The goal of this repository is to showcase my problem‑solving skills, Python practice, and structured approach to learning.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

All solutions are stored in one Python file for convenience.  
Each kata is clearly separated using:

- A **kyu label** (e.g., `# 6 kyu`, `# 7 kyu`)
- A **triple-quoted comment block** `''' ... '''` that contains the entire kata solution

Example:

```python
'''
# 6 kyu

def example_function():
    ...
'''
```

### 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

To document my progress in solving Codewars challenges
To practice Python fundamentals, algorithms, and clean code
To demonstrate my thought process and coding style
To isolate tasks and avoid mixing logic from different kata
To build consistency and track improvement over time

#### 📌 Notes
This repository is continuously updated as I solve new challenges.
Each solution includes the kata level and my chosen approach.
